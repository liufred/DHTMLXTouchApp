Steps to create database for this application:
1. Create a new MySQL db with name "AppDB"
2. Create a new table with name "Tasks" in "AppDB" database.
3. "Tasks" table should have two fields with following properties:
- "id" - integer, auto increment, primary key
- "tasks" - Varchar(80), not null

If you wish to modify db related settings, the same changes should be reflected in data.php in the following code sequence.

	$res = mysql_connect ("localhost", "root", "");
	mysql_select_db ("AppDB");
	$data->render_table ("Tasks","id","task");

mysql_connect parameters:
localhost - MySQL server is hosted on my local machine.
root - Username for MySQL 
"" - Empty password (can be different for you).

mysql_select_db parameters:
AppDB - name of the selected database.

render_table parameters:
Tasks - selected table name on which you want to perform CRUD operations.
id - primary key of the table
task - the associated column on which you want to perform CRUD operations.
